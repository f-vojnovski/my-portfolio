title: Call of Bubble
---

Call of Bubble is a 3D shooter game developed in Unity for Global Game Jam 2025 by team Hatsune Miku Fanclub. 

We were a team of four people and we aimed to create a 3D game on the game jam theme which was "Bubbles".
We were aiming for late 00s feeling in the game, and together with the team we managed to create a fun little
first person shooter where the goal is to kill all the bubbles in the level. I worked as a programmer, audio engineer
and composer on this project.

You can view the entry on the global game jam site [here](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/call-bubble-4).
A gameplay video is available on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g4DebJl6Sb4ePTC1GCSB_4UN_PVp2xu-/view) if you are interested.
The source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/dstojkoski/ggj).

The team consisted of [Stefan](https://www.artstation.com/exuvac), who worked on the 3D assets for this project, while [Sofija](https://github.com/sofiatqsevskaa), [David](https://github.com/dstojkoski/) and me worked as programmers.
