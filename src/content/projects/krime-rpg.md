KrimeRPG is a Python-based Discord bot that powers a crime-themed text-based economy game. Players compete to earn virtual money through various actions and strategic decisions in this multiplayer RPG environment.

The bot was originally developed for Replit.com, using Flask and UptimeRobot to maintain 24/7 uptime despite Replit's idle timeout limitations. The images that are used are from popular media and are found on imgur. It features:

- Persistent player progression using MongoDB for data storage
- Game coordination handled through nextcord.py (a modern Discord.py fork)
- Crime-themed RPG elements with progression systems

I ran this bot on a server and to be honest it was very fun to play, we had about 20 active players at the peak, but it really helped the server activity. 

The source code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/f-vojnovski/KrimeRPG).
