This Android application was developed as a university project demonstrating modern mobile development features with Android Studio and Java. 
The app's purpose is for the users to quickly find solutions for common household problems through uploading a picture and getting a community response.

The project demonstrates how to use Firebase authentication for login and registration, post creation with images (using Firebase storage) and post discovery
with an Algolia integration for easy post discovery. It also demonstrates location based features and me and my friends tested it on our Android devices.
