Rect Slayer is a game developed in Windows Forms using C#.

Me and my colleague were looking for what to develop for our Visual Programming class, and we decided to make a game inspired by the mobile game BBtan.

More details about how this project works, as well as the game itself can be found on the github link: https://github.com/f-vojnovski/RectSlayer
