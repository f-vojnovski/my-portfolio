title: Rect Slayer
---

Rect Slayer is a game developed in Windows Forms using C#.

Me and my colleague were looking for what to develop for our Visual Programming class, and we decided to make a game inspired by the mobile game BBtan.

More details about how this project works, as well as the game itself can be found on the [github link](https://github.com/f-vojnovski/RectSlayer).

I built this project together with [Tose](https://github.com/ToseTodorov).
