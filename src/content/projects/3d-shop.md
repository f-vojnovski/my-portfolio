title: 3D Model Shop
---

This is a web application I developed as a university project where users can trade 3D models as digital products. The platform allows users to upload their own models, purchase others' creations, and preview 3D models directly in their browser.

The backend is built with Laravel using Eloquent ORM, with a SQLite database for product storage. For the frontend, I used React with Redux for state management and React Three Fiber (Three.js) for 3D model rendering. The system handles file storage for model assets and supports user authentication.

Complete documentation as well as the source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/f-vojnovski/3d-shop).
