title: Marzanna Game Engine
---

Marzanna is a game engine I developed for my graduation thesis.
This is a game engine I developed in order to learn more about computer graphics, how game engines work under the hood.
It is developed using C++ using Vulkan for graphics operations.
In this project I have built an abstraction layer in order to support multiple platforms, a 3d renderer with the ability to load in models, an event system and an entity component system.
